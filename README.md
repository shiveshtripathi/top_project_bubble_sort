# Bubble Sort

This project is a solution to the "Bubble Sort" problem from [The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-bubble-sort). The project implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array.

## The Problem

Implement a method `#bubble_sort` that takes an array and returns a sorted array. The algorithm should iterate through the array, comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is completely sorted.

## Usage

1.  Ensure you have Ruby installed.
2.  Save the code in a file (e.g., `bubble_sort.rb`).
3.  Run the file from your terminal. You can test the method by calling it with an array.

**Example:**

```ruby
bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
# => [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 78]
```
